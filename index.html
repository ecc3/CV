        <h3><span>About Me</span></h3>
        <p>
          I really enjoy problem-solving, thinking imaginatively and constantly
          learning. I like diverse challenges and new projects. Having
          considered many careers, from teacher and analyst to curator and urban
          designer, I have decided that becoming a full-stack developer will
          bring me the most pleasure and satisfaction. I am well-rounded, always
          aim for excellence in my work and resilient in stressful environments.
          <!-- I have spent a lot of time wondering what to do. I have considered many avenues from teaching and curating 
                        to urban design and systems analyst. I didn't want to settle for a career I didn't feel inspired by and committed to. 
                        As I pondered, I realised that the aspects of work I really enjoy are problem-solving, thinking imaginatively 
                        and learning new skills. And that I want to be part of creating new tools that could improve lives even in mundane ways. 
                        I like diverse challenges and new projects. As I began coding I began to see something I could 
                        enjoy for a whole career as it is inherently logical, creative and requires constant learning.  -->
